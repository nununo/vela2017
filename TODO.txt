- AnalogDataInput: Separate max/min from thresholds so that the inversion and calibration become simpler
- ArduinoDataInput could inherit from MultiDataInput and only accept AnalogDataInput as input
- Allow inverting sensor values
- Implement calibration and auto-calibration in AnalogInput
- History could get values from any IDataInput
- Add indent parameter to getTrace
- Try omxPlayer
- Review clip output rotation/translation
- Consider implementing a damper
