- Separate max/min from thresholds so that the inversion and calibration become simpler
- Allow inverting sensor values
- Consider implementing a damper
- AnalogInput could implement IDataInput
- ArduinoDataInput can now inherit from MultiDataInput which would accept only AnalogInput as input
- History gets AnalogInput in contructor
- Implement calibration and auto-calibration in AnalogInput
- History could get values from any IDataInput
- Add indent parameter to getTrace
- Try omxPlayer
- Abstract Factory para IDataInput
