- History could get values from any DataInput (Observer pattern) (ofEvent?)
- Add indent parameter to getTrace
- Try omxPlayer in RPI
- Review clip output rotation/translation
- Autoflicker timer reset whenever a trigger happens (it should happen when the candle is idle for some time)
- XML Schema

- Consider implementing a damper

- ArduinoDataInput could inherit from MultiDataInput and only accept ValueInput as input
