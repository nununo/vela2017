- History could get values from any IDataInput
- Add indent parameter to getTrace
- Try omxPlayer
- Review clip output rotation/translation
- Config.createLevelSettingsList shouldn't it be returning a pointer instead of a vector?

- Consider implementing a damper

- ArduinoDataInput could inherit from MultiDataInput and only accept ValueInput as input
